# Beginner graphics project: make a puzzle game!

Here is some starting code for a puzzle game. There will be a start screen (like a lobby) to welcome the player. Once the player clicks the start button, it brings them into the game. Users will be able to click two pieces and swap them, and there will be an algorithm that constantly checks whether or not the puzzle has been solved.

Here is the source code. It has all the basics that you need to get started. Please go over the documentation, especially the graphics code, so that you understand what is going on. *NOTE*: mainStart is the main class with a main class. You will start the program from that code. puzzleGame is another class with no main method.

In the future, most projects you make won't be started from scratch, and will most likely involve modifying or adding onto some source code that you are given. On the other hand, maybe other people will have to read your code, and it needs to be easy to understand. Important documentation and efficient programming will make your code look very clean.

Here are some ways you can add onto this basic code:
- Allow user to choose length and width of puzzle board (and puzzle pieces)
- Count number of swaps
- Have another screen at the end that congratulates the user and displays number of swaps
- Reset button
- DIFFICULT: thread in a timer, have user try to solve the puzzle in a certain amount of time

# Use this code to really make this project your own!
Hope you have fun,
